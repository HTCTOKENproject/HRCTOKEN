# HRCTOKEN
The HRC health care chain is the first health care public chain supported by the Geriatric Care Capital Consortium, a well-known health care organization in the United States. The HRC health care chain empowers the big health industry and is the first to drive the real economy with a token economy + blockchain. HRC uses blockchain technology to reconstruct the entire industry chain of the big health industry, empower the big health industry, enable global users to achieve inclusive health, and make people healthier and wealthier. New industries, new formats, and new models have pushed blockchain technology + health care to a huge market level. Make every effort to build a "Alibaba" in the big health field.
